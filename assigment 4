    <h1>Web Technology Assignment 4 Report</h1>
    
   <h3> Group 178</h3>
   <h3> Yuto Ishihara </h3>
   <h3> Gulben Sarici </h3>
    <p> </p>
    
  <h2>Introduction </h2>
    <p> Generally, the web page is clear about its aim. Also it does not have a main obstacle to cut usability and accessibility. Mostly the page has technical problems that depend on coding and backside area. But it is clear that it will affect the appropriate use of the page for the users. According to appendix A and B, it can be improved. Especially appendix B will help us to evaluate. Appendix A part mainly verified. As the main function of the page, the user can see phone models and costs respectively.</p>
    
  <h2> WCAG guidelines </h2>
   <ul>
   <li> According to W3C, Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. </li>

<p>We used clearly this mean. When we used the orange we point to our navigation titles. When we used to green on our products table, the customers can understand easily and clearly the products name and their information  </p>

<p>On the other hand, we used dark orange to separate add item table to products table.</p>
<li>According to W3C, Bypass Blocks: A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages. (Level A). </li>
<p>We thought that customer does not have to wast time when they look something at our website. We want to give a clear address for they can find easily what they want. Thus, we added a navigation system. It is so understandable and easy system. All customer can use this.</p> </ul> </p>
    
    <h2> Improvement Plan Section</h2>
    
    <h3> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines </h3>
    
      <h5>1.3.1 Info and Relationships: </h5>
      <p> We used ‘id and class’ commands.</p>
      
     <h5> 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence:</h5>
      <p>We focused on this firstly. It was important that website is clearly understandable. We used navigation, information for our company and products. And we added the our contact in the end of website.
 </p>
      <h5>1.4.5 Images of Text </h5>  
      <p> We used some pictures. Some of them explained products. The other two pictures is Amsterdam photo. There focus on our address.
And other one used for our logo.
</p>
      <h5> 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks:  </h5>
      <p>We add a navigation to do this. </p>
      <h5> 2.4.2 Page Titled: </h5
        <p> We add description text under each title. </p>
      <h5>  2.4.3 Focus Order: </h5>
      <p> When we create a navigation we made a ranking from general to specific. We focus on meaning, operation, and purpose of title. It is clearest and understandable.   </p>
<h2> Improvement based on Appendix A</h2>
 <p> We created already this website according to W3C website. Maybe we can add a video, but it is not necessary for our website format.</p>
    
 <h2> Improvement based on Appendix B </h2>
    
    <p> <ul id=1l> 
        <li>We started with 'html', but we should start with 'html lang="en".</li>
        <li>The other point: 'meta charset="UTF-8'. We didn't use this.</li>
        </ul> </p>
